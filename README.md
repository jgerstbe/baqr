# baqr
baQR is a modern take on luggage tags - your home address information as an adhesive address label, perfect for travel lugagge.

## story
baQR was born after playing around with QR codes and them displaying contact information as a vCard. Originally the idea was to use the QR code on a business card - but from there the idea to use it as a luggage tag arose.
